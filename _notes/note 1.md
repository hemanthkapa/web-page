As I sit down to reflect on my first few days in Cape Town, memories rush through me like a river carving its way through a canyon. It all started on March 10th, when I embarked on my very first international flight from Hyderabad, India. The thrill of beginning a new chapter in my life was palpable, but so was the fear of the unknown.


After a brief layover in Dubai, I finally met some of the companions with whom I would be spending the next three months in Cape Town. As we exchanged pleasantries and shared casual chats, a wave of anticipation mounted within us, building to a crescendo of excitement for the adventure that lay ahead. And then, we landed in Cape Town. The beauty of the city was truly mesmerising - the clear sky, stunning views of Table Mountain, and the refreshing sea breeze were all breathtaking. I felt grateful and lucky to have the opportunity to experience such natural splendour.
