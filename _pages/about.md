        I'm a 19-year-old from India, currently delving into the realms of Computer Science and Neuroscience at Dickinson College. Fascinated by the uncharted territories of life, I'm passionately exploring the intricate world of aging, AI, and medical technology. My mission is simple yet profound: solve hard and non-obvious problems that uplift and transform human lives.
